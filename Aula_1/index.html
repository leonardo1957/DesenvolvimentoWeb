				Lorem Ipsum is the standard filler text used in design throughout the world. It’s been the standards since the 1500’s and it’s time for an update. The NASA OpenGov team took the opportunity at Science Hack Day to create a new online tool to generate filler text based on a database of historical space quotes. The project serves as an example of what can be done to utilize historic NASA data and mash it up in a new and exciting way. Although a “lorem ipsum” generator may seem inconsequential at first glance, the weekend project will serve as the backbone to a future data mashup project for the NASA OpenGov team. We’d appreciate your comments and feedback and have provided more information about the history of Lorem Ipsum and the tool we’ve created below.

				Lorem Ipsum text is used because readable text is often a distraction during the design process. For example, when designing a website, a designer will insert lorem ipsum text if the place of real text. Instead of looking at the layout to find the problems or weak spots, people will unconsciously focus on the words. For years, designers have depended on this latin gibberish to help them to focus on the positioning, spacing, color, and other stylistic elements.
